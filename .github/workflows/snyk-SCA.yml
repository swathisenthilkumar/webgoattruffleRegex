# This workflow uses actions that are not certified by GitHub.
# They are provided by a third-party and are governed by
# separate terms of service, privacy policy, and support
# documentation.

# A sample workflow which checks out your Infrastructure as Code Configuration files,
# such as Kubernetes, Helm & Terraform and scans them for any security issues.
# The results are then uploaded to GitHub Security Code Scanning
#
# For more examples, including how to limit scans to only high-severity issues
# and fail PR checks, see https://github.com/snyk/actions/
